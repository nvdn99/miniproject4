The Car Management System is a simple Node.js application that demonstrates the basic functionality of managing a list of cars. This application includes features to view existing cars and add new cars to the list. It uses asynchronous operations and HTTP requests to achieve this functionality.

The code in this repository creates a web server using Node.js's built-in http module. This server serves both HTML content and JSON data, depending on the request type and URL.

## Key Features include:

View Cars: Users can access the root URL ("/") to view a simple HTML page that provides an overview of the Car Management System. They can click the "View Cars" button to see a list of sample cars in JSON format.

Add a New Car: Users can add a new car by filling out a form on the HTML page ("/") and clicking the "Add Car" button. The new car's information (model, year, and color) is added to the list of sample cars.


## Node.js Event Loop

This code uses the event loop for things like reading/writing files and handling web requests. For instance, when you add a car through the form, the code uses callbacks to do the work asynchronously.# miniproject4
